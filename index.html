<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    I am an undergraduate student in Computer Science and Technology at Tongji University, expecting to
    graduate in July 2026.
</p>
<p>
    My research focuses on generative model and multimodal learning, particularly using vision as a foundation for
    reasoning and
    knowledge acquisition. I am passionate about developing unified models to integrate vision,
    language, and other modalities to tackle challenges in complex reasoning and cross-modal learning.

        <ul>
            <li>Addressed inefficiencies in the original Unix V6++ kernel, such as high external
                fragmentation from contiguous memory requirements and slow `fork()` performance.</li>
            <li>Implemented a comprehensive discretization of the process image, enabling non-contiguous
                memory allocation for processes.</li>
            <li>Introduced a copy-on-write (COW) mechanism to minimize overhead during process creation,
