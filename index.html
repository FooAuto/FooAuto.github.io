<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    I am an undergraduate student in Computer Science and Technology at Tongji University, expecting to
    graduate in July 2026.
</p>
<p>
    My research focuses on generative model and multimodal learning, particularly using vision as a foundation for
    reasoning and
    knowledge acquisition. I am passionate about developing unified models to integrate vision,
    language, and other modalities to tackle challenges in complex reasoning and cross-modal learning.
